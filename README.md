# hello-world
Simply my first repository
So this is a commit file, apparently.  As always, I have difficulty understanding these things.  It would have been useful to know what a "sidebar" was before launching into all of this.  Too many assumptions are made about what the learner is already supposed to know.  The instrucitons here are too much like a cake recipe that begins "get a cake."
